# Baseline AIgent ðŸ¤–

An intelligent AI assistant for web developers that generates reliable, cross-browser compatible code based on the Baseline standard.

This project is a submission for the **Baseline Tooling Hackathon**.

## About

Baseline AIgent solves the "AI trust gap" by using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. Instead of relying on potentially outdated internet data, it grounds its knowledge exclusively in the `web-features` dataset, ensuring that every suggestion is modern, safe, and production-ready.
